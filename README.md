### Brainfuck interpreter for the esolang "Text"

Whilst not many people have heard of Text, almost all ASCII files, including readmes,and interpreted programming language source code files, are actually written in Text.
All Text programs output their own source code, thus every program is a quine.

Despite the language being very young, there's already tons of interpreters for Text, perhaps the most famous of which is Notepad. On Unix-derived systems, the traditional interpreter is 'cat'.

The file extension for Text programs is .txt.

Some relatively recent Text interpreters, such as TextEdit on the Macintosh, add support for 2D graphics.

Given that books and paper are fully capable of executing Text programs, they're actually probably some the first computers ever invented.
